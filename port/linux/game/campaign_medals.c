/*
CAMPAIGN_MEDALS.C

The campaign's medals (always, with game.campaign_score; game.campaign_medals
shows or hides those just won, at the center left): those
of Halo 3's and Halo: Reach's that the campaign's weapons, enemies and
vehicles can earn. Each is worth its points (campaign_score_values.json's
"medals", times the difficulty and the skulls, as a kill is), logged as an
entry of the score's log (campaign_score.c), and so sent to a co-op game's
clients as the kills are.

- multi-kills: Double Kill to Killionaire, kills within the multi-kill
  window of the one before;
- sprees, kills without dying: Killing Spree (5) to Unfriggenbelievable (40);
  and of a weapon's kills, 5 and 10: Shotgun Spree and Open Season, Sniper
  Spree and Sharpshooter, Splatter Spree and Vehicular Manslaughter, and
  Stick Spree (5 plasma grenades stuck);
- a kill's: Beat Down (melee), Assassin (melee from behind), Headshot,
  Sniper Kill, Grenade Stick, Splatter, Incineration (the flamethrower), Death
  from the Grave (the killer dead), Close Call (the killer's shield down and
  health low), First Strike (the level's first kill), Revenge (the player's
  last killer killed), Avenger (another player's) and Wheelman (a passenger,
  an AI's gunner too, killing while the player drives);
- the level's: Perfection, won without dying, with enough kills.

In a multiplayer game (game.multiplayer_medals: campaign_score.c) the same
medals but Perfection are a kill of another player's, an enemy's; Revenge is
the player's last killer killed, as a player (their unit is new each time
they spawn), and Avenger a teammate's, in a team game.

The weapon is told by the killing blow's damage effect's name (the JSON's
"weapons": sniper rifle\sniper bullet, plasma grenade\attached, ...).

Only the machine that runs the AI gives medals, as it scores the kills (the
host of a co-op game); in a multiplayer game each machine gives its own
players theirs, from the kills every machine is told of (with the host's
killer and killing blow: network_damage.c), and no other machine hears of
them. Every machine shows its own players' as they are logged: the medals just won at the center left of the view, up to ten (two
rows of five, the newest first) for the JSON's popup_seconds each, and the
last few, the medal history, in the score's panel (campaign_score.c).
