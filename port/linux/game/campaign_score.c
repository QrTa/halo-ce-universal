/*
CAMPAIGN_SCORE.C

The campaign's score (game.campaign_score, Settings > Gameplay > Scoring's
SCORING, off by default: the stock game has none), as Halo 3's and the Master
Chief Collection's. Its values are campaign_score_values.json's
(campaign_score_values.c, which tools/campaign_score_values.py writes from it
as the build is configured):

- a kill is worth its enemy's base points (by its actor's type and its
  variant's name, or a vehicle's by its name), times its style's multiplier
  (one shot one kill, a headshot, a melee hit, a backsmack: from behind),
  times the difficulty's, times the skulls on, rounded to a point;
- an ally killed (or a friendly vehicle destroyed), another player killed
  (a betrayal), a death and Revert to Checkpoint take points as they are
  (the only cost of a checkpoint: the score and the time go on through it);
- when the level is won, its points are multiplied by its time's multiplier,
  by its time over the level's par time.

Only the machine that runs the AI knows the kills: the host of a co-op
game, or a single player. The host sends each entry, and the level's win, to
the clients of a network co-op game (network_coop.c), which keep the same
log. A co-op game's score is the players' added together (network.coop_score_type
"cooperative") or each player's own ("competitive"); the host's choice counts.

The score is a log of entries, each with the game time it happened at and
its player's absolute index (the same on every machine of a co-op game); the
totals are summed from it. Going back to a checkpoint (a death, or Revert to
Checkpoint) takes nothing from the log, nor from the level's time, which is
counted on each tick the game time goes forward (campaign_score_tick), not
read from it.

On the HUD, the score and the level's time (a strip of the par time left
over them, and a row of the score's multipliers: the difficulty's, the
skulls', the time's and their total) are a panel at the bottom right, as the
Master Chief Collection's (campaign_score_draw_view); the skulls' icons are drawn
above it (skulls.c, campaign_score_hud_height). The scoreboard (hold BACK, or
tab: game_engine.c) lists every player's score.

In a multiplayer game (game.multiplayer_scoring, Settings > Gameplay >
Scoring's MULTIPLAYER) nothing is scored: each machine gives its own
players the campaign's medals (game.multiplayer_medals:
campaign_score_player_killed, campaign_medals.c), logged as entries here
for their history and popups, and draws its own players' panel
(game.multiplayer_score_hud): their kills, deaths and assists, and the game
type's score (captures, time on the hill). No other machine is told of
either.

When a level is won (main_won_map) its totals, its time against its par,
each player's score and the best variants are written to the log, and shown
over the level until A or B is pressed, before the main menu (or the co-op
lobby) loads.
